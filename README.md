# VB_Final
We have made a set of multiple games (such as Alien Invaderz, Tic Tac Toe 2Player/vs computer, and Horse Racing) and a Log In screen.
The program starts off with a Log In screen and ask  you to input a user name to be inputed for saving.
After you have input the user name you would like to be saved to the leaderboards, the program will take you to a main menu.
Here on this main menu will be four games listed in this order:
1. Alien Invaderz
2. 2 Player Tic Tac Toe
3. Tic Tac Toe vs Computer
4. Horse Racing

Below is a flow chart of how our program works:
